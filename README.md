new-atarist-boot-manager
========================

The previously unreleased sequal to atarist-boot-manager

Ah, what might have been...

Contains source code and executable, never quite got around to activating the code that wrote the file information. Ready to be finished if anyone wants. Full windowed environment, for a VT-52 style screen, complete keyboard control. A must for GUI researchers everywhere.
