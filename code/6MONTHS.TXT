This doc is the documentation written over 6 months after looking
at the program code in an attempt to see what has bee used, what
state I am at and how to proceed.

so let's start with the main program!

vt52.c
------

It includes rather a lot of stuff and I'm not sure that it is all needed


main_loop2
	print the current window
	handle any keypresses until escape is pressed


main
	this is still using the concept of 
		prog, acc, set and other
	when it should be getting a window list from
	a file and if it fails to find that then it
	should read the sets file and create default windows based upon that
	(if that is possible)
